## Cricket
I enjoy cricket because it combines **dramatic moments** with great play, and it has a long tradition and depth of **strategy**. I feel like I am a part of a strong group because of the friendship and **sportsmanship**. In addition, the excitement of a fiercely contested match or a **riveting play** is indescribable.
